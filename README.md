# Learning Assembly

A hands-on journey into x86-64 Assembly language, focusing on building understanding through incremental projects and practical experimentation.

---

## üìï Learning Philosophy

This repository documents my progression from Assembly fundamentals to more complex systems programming concepts. Rather than just reading about Assembly, every concept is explored through working code that I can build, run, and modify.

Each project builds on previous knowledge while introducing new challenges that deepen my understanding of how computers work at the lowest level. Coming from higher-level languages like C# and JavaScript, this journey helps me understand what actually happens "under the hood" when I write code.

## üìö Learning Path

### Phase 1: Register Fundamentals 
**Current Focus: Understanding CPU registers and basic data movement**

**01-register-fundamentals/**
- **register-swapper**: Basic register manipulation using a temporary register to swap values
- **arithmetic-swap**: Swapping register values without extra storage using arithmetic operations

**Key Concepts Learned:**
- What registers are and why they're faster than memory
- The `MOV` instruction for data movement
- How constraints force creative problem-solving in Assembly
- Basic arithmetic operations (`ADD`, `SUB`) with registers

### Phase 2: Basic Arithmetic (Coming Soon)
**Planned Focus: Mathematical operations and result handling**

**02-basic-arithmetic/**
- **calculator**: Simple arithmetic operations with multiple registers
- **comparison-ops**: Understanding flags and conditional logic

### Phase 3: Control Flow (Future)
**Planned Focus: Jumps, loops, and conditional execution**

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Environment

**Architecture**: x86-64  
**Assembler**: MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler)  
**Platform**: Windows 11  
**Editor**: Visual Studio Code  
**Build Tools**: Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools

---

## üîß Building Projects

Each project contains a `main.asm` file. To build all projects at once, run the build script from the repository root:

```batch
build.bat
```

This will automatically find and compile all `main.asm` files throughout the project structure, creating executables with descriptive names that indicate which project they came from.

To build individual projects, navigate to the specific project folder and run:
```bash
ml64 main.asm /link /subsystem:windows /entry:main
```

## üìñ Learning Resources (TO-DO)

**resources/**
- **instruction_sheet.md**: Quick reference for Assembly instructions
- **debug_notes.md**: Common errors and troubleshooting steps

---

## üß† Key Insights So Far

**Why Assembly Matters**: Understanding Assembly provides insight into performance implications in higher-level languages. When I write `int result = a + b;` in C#, I now understand the register operations happening behind the scenes.

**Register Constraints**: Working with limited registers (16!!) teaches resource management and forces elegant solutions to problems that higher-level languages abstract away.

**Step-by-Step Thinking**: Assembly requires breaking down every operation into its fundamental components, which improves problem-solving skills in all programming contexts.

**CPU Understanding**: Learning how the CPU actually processes instructions provides a foundation for understanding topics like optimization, memory management, and system performance.

## üéØ Current Goals

- Master basic arithmetic operations and register management
- Understand how high-level language constructs (loops, conditionals) translate to Assembly
- Build familiarity with the x86-64 instruction set
- Develop debugging skills for low-level code
